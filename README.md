# RemoteDesk2K - Remote Desktop for Windows 2000

A remote desktop application with UltraViewer/AnyDesk-like interface, designed for Windows 2000.

## Downloads

| File | Description | Size |
|------|-------------|------|
| **RD2K_Setup.exe** | Client installer (includes RemoteDesk2K.exe) | ~130 KB |
| **relay.exe** | Relay server (separate, for admins only) | ~33 KB |

> ⚠️ **Important:** The relay server (`relay.exe`) is **NOT included** in the installer.  
> It is distributed separately for server administrators only.

### No Cloud Server Yet

Currently, there is **no public cloud-hosted relay server**. To use relay mode:

1. **You or someone in your network** must run `relay.exe` on a server/PC with a public IP or port forwarding
2. Start the relay server and copy the generated **Server ID**
3. Distribute the Server ID to client users
4. Clients can then connect through the relay

> 💡 **Direct Connection** still works without any relay server if both PCs are on the same network!

## Build Environment

- Windows 2000 DDK (Driver Development Kit)
- Windows 2000 SDK (Software Development Kit)
- Microsoft Visual C++ (cl.exe) from DDK
- Standard C (C89/C90) language

> **Note:** The build uses `build.bat` (Windows batch) and does not require a Makefile. All code is written in portable C for Windows 2000.
## Building

### Requirements
- Windows 2000 SDK
- Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (cl.exe)

### Build Steps
```batch
cd RemoteDesk2K

# Build client application
cd client
build.bat              # Creates RemoteDesk2K.exe

# Build relay server (admin only)
cd ../relay
build_relay.bat        # Creates relay.exe

# Build installer (optional)
cd ../installer
build_installer.bat    # Creates RD2K_Setup.exe (embeds client)
```

## Usage

### As Host (Being Controlled)
1. Run `RemoteDesk2K.exe`
2. Note your **ID** and **Password** shown on left panel
3. Share these with your partner
4. Wait for connection

### As Viewer (Controlling)
1. Run `RemoteDesk2K.exe`
2. Enter the **Server ID** (e.g., `A7K2-M9PL-X3QR`) provided by admin
3. Enter partner's **Password**
4. Click "Connect to partner"
5. Use the viewer window to control remote PC

### Relay Server Admin
1. Run `relay.exe`
2. Configure relay IP and port
